# üåû Autonomous Sundial

**Author:** JƒÅnis Birznieks  
**Year:** 2025

This project is a physical, electromechanical sundial system that autonomously tracks the sun‚Äôs position to display accurate local solar time. It combines mechanical actuation, environmental sensing, and real-time data integration across three cooperating devices.

## üîß System Overview

The system runs across three hardware platforms, each with its own software component:

### 1. **ESP32 (Firmware: `main.cpp`)**
- Controls two stepper motors (azimuth + tilt)
- Reads sensor data (LDRs, AS5600 analog angle sensors, limit switches)
- Implements the full state machine (OFF, ON, PAUSED, RESET)  
- Executes sun-seeking and initialization subroutines

### 2. **Raspberry Pi (Script: `ESPSerialSender.py`)**
- Sends current time and location to the ESP32
- Reads serial telemetry from the ESP32
- Stores all received data in a local MySQL database

### 3. **Database/Visualization Machine (Script: `Sundial_Plots.py`)**
- Connects to the MySQL database
- Displays:
  - Polar chart for real-time azimuth
  - Polar chart for gnomon tilt
  - Smoothed time-series plots of LDR data
  - Live system state indicator
